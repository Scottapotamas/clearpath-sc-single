# clearpath-sc-single
Cut down variant of the clearpath SC4-Hub for single motor use.

## Overview

The Clearpath line of motors from Teknic are great for robotics due to tight integration of controller and motor.

The SC series are software controllable, but rely on the use of a communications hub for level shifting and e-stop etc.

My application is space constrained, so this single channel board offers the same main functionality (but we lose e-stop and brake outputs, and less defensive filtering) in a reduced form factor.
